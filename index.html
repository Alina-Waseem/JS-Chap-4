        <h2 >Exercise 4.1</h2>
        <p>1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.</p>
        <p>2. Output the value of the variable to the console.</p>
        <p>3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console,using the following syntax:</p>
        <p>if(myVariable){
            //action
            }</p>
        <p>4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether 
            the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the 
            console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an 
            ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement 
            insteadâ€”experiment!</p>
        <p>5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.</p>
        <h2 >Exercise 4.2</h2>
        <p>1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age</p>
        <p>2. Convert the response from the prompt to a number</p>
        <p>3. Declare a message variable that you will use to hold the console message for 
            the user</p>
        <p>4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to 
            confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol</p>
        <p>5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to 
            confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol</p>
        <p>6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if 
            none are true</p>
        <p>7. Output the response message variable to the console</p>
        <h2 >Exercise 4.3</h2>
        <p>1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable</p>
        <p>2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether 
            their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not</p>
        <p>3. Output the response to the console</p>   
        <h2 >Exercise 4.4</h2>    
        <p>1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value 
            is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You 
            can increase this number as you add more results.</p>
        <p>2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can 
            repeat back in the final output.</p>
        <p>3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different 
            value from the random number generator.</p>
        <p>4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence 
            printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case, 
            assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.</p>
        <p>5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case 
            response, to the console after the user enters their question.</p>
        <h2>Exercise 4.5</h2>
        <p>1. Create a variable called prize and use a prompt to ask the user to set the 
            value by selecting a number between 0 and 10</p>
        <p>2. Convert the prompt response to a number data type</p>
        <p>3. Create a variable to use for the output message containing the value "My 
            Selection: "</p>
        <p>4. Using the switch statement (and creativity), provide a response back 
            regarding a prize that is awarded depending on what number is selecte</p>
        <p>5. Use the switch break to add combined results for prizes</p>
        <p>6. Output the message back to the user by concatenating your prize variable 
            strings and the output message string</p>
